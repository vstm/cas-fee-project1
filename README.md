# CAS FEE Project1

This is the first project of the CAS FEE 2019. The conditions where to use no
frameworks and few libraries (mostly templating).

## Running it locally

To run the project locally you need to use at least version v12.1.0. The older
versions might not be supported (the Code does not yet run with lts/dubnium 
v10.15.x)

To run it locally you have to install the depnedencies first with the following
command:

    npm ci

After that, you can start the porject with

    npm start

It will then open a server at http://localhost:3000

## Online demo

You can test it online here: https://project1.cas-fee.svetsch.ch/ - it does not
have authentication yet and all messages are visible for anyone. Please don't
write nasty messages :)
